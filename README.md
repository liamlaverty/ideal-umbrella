Messing around with Umbraco 


## Run the application 

- open a terminal 
- change into the site's directory `cd .\IdealUmbrella.site\`
- launch the site using `dotnet run`
 

## Carbon Aware Github actions 
The site uses the Green Software Foundation's carbon aware API via Stebje's github action: https://github.com/stebje/jord. This will delay the build action if there is a greener time to run it in the near future.
