# Docker

The applications can be hosted in Docker. The documentation expects you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.

Installs the following:

- Microsoft MSSQL Server with Umbraco database & user preconfigured
- Postgres SQL Server with preconfigured climate data tables
- Umbraco backoffice dotnet application 
- Umbraco frontend dotnet application 

## Quick-start Docker
If you're just looking around, run the following commands to quick-install the applications:
```bash
docker volume create ideal_umbrella_postgres_data
docker compose --env-file ./.env.example up --build 
```

*Note* this uses credentials stored in git, do not use the `.env.example` file for anything but local development. See [Detail](#detail) for full setup details

## Full Docker Install

1. Create a volume for your postgres data to persist on 

```bash
docker volume create ideal_umbrella_postgres_data
```
 
2. Copy contents of `.env.example` into `.env`
3. Adjust the values in `.env` *these are secrets, do not commit them*
4. Run the command to deploy the applications into docker containers

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Full Docker Uninstall
To clear down the docker application & revert the installation
1. Run the `down` command:

```bash 
docker compose down --rmi local --volumes
```
2. remove the persisted postgres volume

```bash
docker volume rm ideal_umbrella_postgres_data
```

## Docker MSSQL Server on Apple Silicon

If you're using a first generation Apple Silicon Mac, you will need to configure Rosetta Emulation to get MSSQL server running:

- Open docker desktop
- Click the Settings cog in the top right
- In the *General* tab, make sure *Use virtualization framework* is set to `true`
- Click *Features in Development*
- Set *Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon* to `true`
  

## Docker Healthcheck conditions
Containers check their health on startup. Some services depend on another service's healthcheck returning positive before starting up.

#### MSSQL health
* Depends on no other container

The MSSQL container startup creates a database & user for the Umbraco applications. It will report *Unhealthy* until the Umbraco database & user is created. 

#### Postgres health
* Depends on no other container

The Postgres container uses the built-in `pg_isready` command to report its health.

#### Umbraco Backoffice health
* Depends on [MSSQL/Healthy](#mssql-health)

The Umbraco Backoffice container will wait for the MsSQL container's *healthy* prompt before starting up.

It will report *Unhealthy* until a 200 is returned. On first launch, this will be after uSync has completed its import.

#### Umbraco Frontend(s) health
* Depends on [MSSQL/Healthy](#mssql-health) & [Umbraco Backoffice/Healthy](#umbraco-backoffice-health)

The Umbraco backoffice will wait for the Umbraco Backoffice container to report Healthy

## Docker `.env` environment variables

In this example, configs are set in the `.env` file. When pulling the repository initially, you'll need to copy `.env.example` into `.env`. You should change the values in `.env`. Ideally these should be moved into [Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/use-secrets/) 

#### General Settings
- `PROJECT_FRIENDLY_NAME` is a friendly name for your project - it's used in Docker to name some containers and networks

#### Postgres Server Admin Credentials
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE_SERVER_AND_CONTAINER_NAME`, the login credential for your Posgres admin user
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE_DB`, the login credential for your Posgres admin user
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE_USER`, the login credential for your Posgres admin user
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE_PASSWORD`,  the login credential for your Posgres admin user
POSTGRES_DATABASE_DATA='/data/example-postgres-data'

#### Database Server Admin credentials:

- `UMBRACO_DATABASE_SERVER_SA_USERNAME` defualts to `sa`
- `UMBRACO_DATABASE_SERVER_SA_PASSWORD` Should be a string, and should confirm to Microsoft's SA password restrictions (at least 8 characters, with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols)

#### Umbraco database credentials:
- `UMBRACO_DATABASE_USERNAME_STRING`, your Umbraco database user's username
- `UMBRACO_DATABASE_PASSWORD_STRING`, your Umbraco database user's password. Should confirm to Microsoft's database password restrictions (at least 8 characters, with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols)

#### Database config
- `UMBRACO_DATABASE_SERVER_AND_CONTAINER_NAME`, this is the name of the container your database will live in. You'll sometimes use this value instead of `localhost` when connecting to the database from inside of another docker container
- `UMBRACO_DATABASE_NAME`, this is your Umbraco database's name

#### Umbraco unattended installs
These settings match the [Umbraco Unattended Install ðŸ”—](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/install/unattended-install) variables
- `UMBRACO_CMS_UNATTENDED_INSTALLUNATTENDED`, allows you to configure unattended installations. If this is set to `false`, the `website-frontend` container won't startup until after you've run a manual installation
- `UMBRACO_CMS_UNATTENDED_UNATTENDED_USERNAME`, the default user's username for an unattended install
- `UMBRACO_CMS_UNATTENDED_UNATTENDED_EMAIL`, the default user's email for an unattended install
- `UMBRACO_CMS_UNATTENDED_UNATTENDED_PASSWORD`, the default user's password for an unattended install

#### Mapbox config
- `MAPBOX_FRONTEND_KEY`, your mapbox front-end key. It should begin `pk`, and it should be configured to allow use on your domain. For localhost, you'll need to include the port number

# CI/CD & Github Actions

## Carbon Aware Github actions 
The site uses the Green Software Foundation's carbon aware API via Stebje's github action: https://github.com/stebje/jord. This will delay the build action if there is a greener time to run it in the near future.  


# Development

## User secrets

To enable user secrets in dev, follow the guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=windows#secret-manager

- Run `dotnet user-secrets init` to init the user secret feature in your dev env
- Set secrets with `dotnet user-secrets set "json:path:to:your:secrete:key" "value"`

### Secrets to set

`dotnet user-secrets set "MapboxConfig:Settings:FrontEndKey" "your-mapbox-api-key-here"`


## Run the application 

- open a terminal 
- change into the site's directory `cd .\IdealUmbrella.site\`
- launch the site using `dotnet run`
